To run the application, run university _search.py using Python 3.

This application will help you look up a list of universities based on the country, upper and lower ranking limit.

To start the search, you will need to provide a 2-digit country code. You may look up the code in need at this webpage https://countrycode.org. Use the 2-character ISO code from the ISO code column.

Follow the prompt. The final results will be shown in a browser using Flask.
