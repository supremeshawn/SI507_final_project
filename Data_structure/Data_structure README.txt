Files in this folder shows the data structure used for this project.

While the information is stored as a massive dictionary. The project uses the information to construct a list of objects of the class University.

The list of objects is used to construct a binary search tree. Every node is an object of the University class. All internal nodes have two children notes which are also objects of the University class. The location of the object within a tree is determined based on the "ranking" attribute of that object. As I print the tree using inorder() method, I sort the tree based on rankings.
